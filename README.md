# Instagram Scraper

This project provides a Python-based tool to scrape your Instagram followers and following lists, and identify users who donâ€™t follow you back. It uses the [`instagrapi`](https://github.com/adw0rd/instagrapi) library for API interactions with Instagram and `.env` files to securely store your credentials.

---

## Features

- Retrieve and compare your Instagram followers and following lists.
- Identify users who are not following you back.
- Securely store and manage Instagram credentials using environment variables.
- Easy-to-use and extendable code.

---

## Prerequisites

Before using the tool, ensure that you have the following:

1. **Python**: Python 3.8 or above installed.
2. **Instagram Account**: An Instagram account is required to log in.
3. **Two-Factor Authentication**: If enabled, you may need to handle OTP manually or adjust the script for two-factor login.
